# Order-ahead-for-pickup
Code for the paper "Order ahead for pickup: Promise or peril?"

## Python environment

The Python code was tested under Python 3.13 (Anaconda base environment).

Required packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib


## Figure 4 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 4 is located in `matlab/Fig4/`.
This figure illustrates the throughput of the order-ahead and order-onsite models
when remote customers do not have delay information, under different travel rate β.


## Figure 5 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 5 is located in `matlab/Fig5/`.
The file `Fig5_THmax_AheadOnsite.m` compares the throughput of the order-ahead and
order-onsite models under optimal information.

The file `OrderAhead_Info.m` plots the throughput of the order-ahead model when
remote customers have delay information.

For the order-onsite model under the information case, the throughput is generated by
the main function FPE_gamma.m.
This main function calls the following auxiliary functions: est_gamma.m; rst_gamma.m; NHQBD_gamma.m; Observable_gamma.m


## Figure 7 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 7 is located in `matlab/Fig7/`.
This code helps plot the throughput of Order-Ahead-with-Cancellation model under different travel rates β.
