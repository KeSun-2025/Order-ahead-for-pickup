# Order-ahead-for-pickup
Code for the paper "Order ahead for pickup: Promise or peril?"

## Python environment

The Python code was tested under Python 3.13 (Anaconda base environment).

Required packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib


## Figure 4 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 4 is located in `matlab/Fig4/`.
This figure illustrates the throughput of the order-ahead and order-onsite models
when remote customers do not have delay information, under different travel rate β.


## Figure 5 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 5 is located in `matlab/Fig5/`.
The file `Fig5_THmax_AheadOnsite.m` compares the throughput of the order-ahead and
order-onsite models under optimal information.

The file `OrderAhead_Info.m` plots the throughput of the order-ahead model when
remote customers have delay information.

For the order-onsite model under the information case, the throughput is generated by
the main function FPE_gamma.m.
This main function calls the following auxiliary functions: est_gamma.m; rst_gamma.m; NHQBD_gamma.m; Observable_gamma.m


## Figure 7 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 7 is located in `matlab/Fig7/`.
This code helps plot the throughput of the Order-Ahead-with-Cancellation model under different travel rates β.


## Figure 9 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 9 is located in `matlab/Fig9/`.
This code helps plot the throughput of the Order-Ahead-with-Cancellation model with a fixed travel rate β.

## Figure 10 (Matlab)
The code for Figure 10 is located in `matlab/Fig10/`.
This code plots the throughput under the optimal mechanism with optimal information for a fixed travel rate β.


## Figure 11 (Matlab)

The code for Figure 11 is located in matlab/Fig11/.
This figure is generated using three separate Matlab code, each corresponding to a different model:

Fig11_HeteroTravel_OrderAhead.m: Order-ahead model

Fig11_HeteroTravel_OrderAheadRejection.m: Order-ahead-with-rejection model

Fig11_HeteroTravel_OrderOnsite.m: Order-onsite model

They plot the throughput under heterogeneous travel rates across different ranges of β.

To generate the throughput for different β intervals, users only need to modify the parameter beta_m in the corresponding script:

beta_m = 0.5 corresponds to the travel rate interval β ∈ [0, 1]

beta_m = 1 corresponds to the travel rate interval β ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

beta_m = 2 corresponds to the travel rate interval β ∈ [1.5, 2.5]


## Figure EC1 (Matlab)

The code for Figure EC1 is located in `matlab/FigEC1/`.

- `FigEC1_Cancellation_max.m` computes the throughput under the cancellation model with optimal information.
- `FigEC1_OrderAhead_max.m` computes the throughput under the order-ahead model with optimal information.
- `FigEC1_Rejection_max.m` computes the throughput under the rejection model with optimal information.
  
Users can modify the value of `d` in each script to generate results.
